1. Compile and Run. type `make` then `./a0 < [file.ojb]`
2. No collaboration.
3. Extra credits:
    add zoom-in & zoom-out
    add rotate by mouse

4. Known problems on mouse based control:
    Rotation (possibley on up-down x-axis) may go reversely,
    maybe because the up-direction vector is not set during rotation.
